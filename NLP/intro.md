**Natural Language Processing: Zero to NLP**
Batch: November 2022
"Natural Language Processing: Zero to NLP" is a practical introduction to modern natural language processing techniques, tools, and ML models. The course takes a coding-focused approach towards understanding and applying ideas from 50+ years of NLP research to real-world problems and datasets.

Prerequisites: Data Analysis with Python, Machine Learning with Python, and Deep Learning with PyTorch (basic knowledge)

NOTE: This course is currently paused (since Jan 2023), we'll send out an announcement when we're ready to add new lectures.
